Map of regional public transports based on OpenStreetMap

## Purpose
The goal was to make a global transportation map which would be more readable than the existant ones, especially by taking into account the colour attribute for bus and train lines.

## How it works
The map is displayed by Mapbox, composed of a custom background with little saturated colours, and a dozen of transportation layers on top, whose data has to be downloaded.
